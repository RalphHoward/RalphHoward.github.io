These notes are set so that you get to prove the main results
by solving smaller problems that when put together give the big result.
The answers to the problems are in the videos.

<h3>The basics of systems of differential equations.</h3> 
<br><br>

A <i>system of differential equations</i>, as opposed to a single 
differential equation is a set of more than one equation for
more than one unknown functions.    Here we will mostly 
consider sets of two equations for two unknown functions.  The
most basic version of this is a system of the form
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= f(t,x(t),y(t))\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= g(t,x(t),y(t))
\end{align*}

We first record the fact that such equations always have 
solutions

<br><br>
<b>Theorem:</b><i> <i>(Existence and uniqueness for first order systems.) </i>  
Assume the functions \(f(t,x,y)\) and \(t,x,y)\) have continuous
first partial derivatives.  Then the for any \(t_0\) and
numbers \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) the initial value problem 
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= f(t,x(t),y(t)),&& x(t_0)=x_0\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= g(t,x(t),y(t)),&& y(t_0)=y_0
\end{align*}
has a unique solution.
</i><br><br>

(Note to any mathematician reading this:  I am aware that this 
statement should be more precise about domains and that the solution
is only necessarily defined on a neighborhood \(\{ t: |t-t_0|<
\delta\}\) of \(t_0\).)
<br><br>
Those not interested in theory can skip ahead to the next section
on <b>Dealing with autonomous systems graphically.</b>  
<br>
<br>

To relate this back to equations we have looked at, consider
the second order equations
$$
x''(t) + p(t)x'(t) + q(t) x(t) = f(t).
$$
If we introduce a variable for the derivative, that is
let
$$
y(t) = x'(x)
$$
then
$$
y'(t) = x''(x).
$$
and we can rewrite the equation as
$$
y'(t) + p(t)y(t) + q(t) x(t) = f(t)
$$
Solving for \(y'(x)\) gives
$$
y'= -q(t)x(t) - p(x) y(t) + f(t).
$$

Putting this all together gives
<br><br>
<b>Theorem:</b><i>
The second order initial value problem
$$
x''(x)+p(t)x'(t) + q(t)x(t) = f(t) \qquad x(t_0)=x_0,\quad x'(t_0) = y_0
$$
is equivalent to the first order system 
\begin{align*}
x'(t) &= y(y)&& x(t_0)=x_0\\
y'(t) &= -q(t)x(t) - p(x) y(t) + f(t)&&y(t_0)=y_0.
\end{align*}
</i><br><br>

The point of this is that we can use the 
Existence and uniqueness for first order systems
to see that we also have unique solutions for 
second order differential equations. (But this
is probably mostly interesting to people, such
as mathematicians, that wish to unify the theory
and to some people writing computer programs for 
solving differential equations so that they can write
programs that cover the widest number of types of equations.)
<br>

<h3> Dealing with autonomous systems graphically.</h3>
<br>

The system is <i>autonomous</i>  if and only if the variable \(t\)
is not explicitly in the equations.  That is it is of form
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= f(x(t),y(t)),&& x(t_0)=x_0\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= g(x(t),y(t)),&& y(t_0)=y_0
\end{align*}
Which we will usually write in the more compact form
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= f(x,y),&& x(t_0)=x_0\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= g(x,y),&& y(t_0)=y_0
\end{align*}
or even 
\begin{align*}
\dot x &= f(x,y),&& x(t_0)=x_0\\
\dot y &= g(x,y),&& y(t_0)=y_0
\end{align*}
where the dot notation, which goes back to Issac Newton, is
used to denote the derivative with respect to \(t\) (which is
generally though of as time).
<br>
<br>

An autonomous system has a pleasant geometric interpolation.
On the plane consider the vector field
$$
\mathbf v(x,y) = f(x,y)\,\mathbf i + g(x,y)\,\mathbf j.
$$
Then if \((x,y)\) = \((x(t),y(t))\) is a solution to the 
system
\begin{align*}
\dot x &= f(x,y)\\
\dot y &= g(x,y)
\end{align*}
the curve
$$
\mathbf c(t) = (x(t),y(t))
$$
has $\mathbf v$ as its velocity vector at each point. That is
$$
\dot{\mathbf c}(t)= \mathbf v(\mathbf c(t)) = \mathbf v(x(t),y(t)). 
$$
To see this in action let us consider the systemm
\begin{align*}
\dot x &= -2 x + y\\
\dot y &= x - 3y 
\end{align*}

<br>
and click on the tab that which is labeled <b>System</b>. 
You should something that looks like:
<br>

<center>
 <img src="systems1.png" alt="picture of ode plotter." width="900" > 
</center>
 <br>

 This is for the default  system on the site which is
\begin{align*}
\dot x &= x+y \\
\dot y &=  xy-1
\end{align*}

To change the system to the one we are after 
edit the formulas for \(dx/dt\)
and \(dy/dt\) to  our functions (\(-2x+y\) and \(x-3y\)).
The picture now looks like

<br>

<center>
 <img src="systems2.png" alt="picture of ode plotter." width="900" > 
</center>
 <br>

The arrows point in the direction that a solution to the equation
will be moving.  Now let us plot a couple of solutions.  
To start let us look at the solution with
$$
x(0)=2, \qquad y(0)=-1
$$
Click on the <b>PLOT NUMERICAL SOLUTION CURVES</b>  
and where it says <i>enter (x,y)</i>  
enter \( (2,-1)\) and click on <b>submit</b>    Things should now look like:



<br>

<center>
 <img src="systems3.png" alt="picture of ode plotter." width="900" > 
</center>
 <br>

The red curve is the track of the solution starting at \((2,-1)\)
and shows that if is ``pushed'' by the arrows to the origin.  
If we plot anther initial condition, say
$$
x(0)= -2,\qquad y(0)=2.5
$$
we get both solutions (the second one in green) on the graph:

<br>

<center>
 <img src="systems4.png" alt="picture of ode plotter." width="900" > 
</center>
 <br>

Here is a more interesting example.  We look at the system
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &=y\\
\frac{dy}{d} &= -\sin(2x)
\end{align*}
and let us plot the solutions with initial conditions
$$
(x(0),y(0)) = (1,0),\qquad (x(0),y(0))=(.2,-.3),\qquad 
(x(0),y(0)= (-3,2).
$$
Before plotting click on the bottom that says
<b>Euler</b>  and change it to <b>Improved Euler (Heun)</b>  
The result should look like


<br>

<center>
 <img src="systems5.png" alt="picture of ode plotter." width="900" > 
</center>
 <br>

If it does not and yu have some red and green spirals running off
of the graph, then that most likely means you did not change 
the <b>Euler</b>  to <b>Improved Euler (Heun)</b>. 

<br><br>
<b>Problem:</b>
For the system 
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &=y\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= \sin(2x) - . 1 y
\end{align*}
with the four initial conditions 
$$
(x(0),y(0)) = (1,0),\qquad (x(0),y(0))=(-.2,-.3),\qquad 
(x(0),y(0)= (-3,2),\qquad (x(0),y(0)) = (1,-2)
$$
using <b>Improved Euler (Heun)</b>.
