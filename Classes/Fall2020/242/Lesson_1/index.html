These notes are set so that you get to prove the main results
by solving smaller problems that when put together give the big result.
The answers to the problems are in the videos.  
You will get the most out of these notes if you do (or try) the problems
before looking at the videos.

To get a bit more of a feel for what a differential equation tell us,
let us look at the special case of equations of the form
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)
$$
That is the equation has no explicit dependence on the variable \(x\).
Here is a variant of one we did in class.
