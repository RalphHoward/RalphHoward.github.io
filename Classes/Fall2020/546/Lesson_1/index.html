These notes are set so that you get to prove the main results
by solving smaller problems that when put together give the big result.
The answers to the problems are in the videos.  
You will get the most out of these notes if you do (or try) the problems

<h2> Greatest common divisors and ideals.</h2>

<br><br>
<b>Definition:</b>
Let \(a\) and \(b\) be integers not both zero.  Then 
\(d\) is a <b>greatest common divisor</b>  of \(a\) and
\(b\) if and only if
<ul>
	<li> \(d>0\)</li>
	<li> \(d\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\). </li>
	<li>if \(c\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), then \(c\) divides \(d\). </li>
</ul>

<br><br>

We have also defined:

<br><br>
<b>Definition:</b>
A subset \(I\) of the integers \(\mathbb Z\) is an <b>ideal</b>  if and only if
\(I \ne \varnothing\) and
<ul>
	<li>\(I\) is closed under addition. (That is if \(a,b\in I\)
	then also \(a+b\in I\).</li>
	<li> if \( a in I\) and \(n\in \mathbb Z\), then \(na \in I\). (That is
	\(I\) is closed under multiplication by any element of \(\mathbb Z\).)</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

If \(d\) is an integer then the set \(d\mathbb Z=\{nd: n \in \mathbb Z\}\)
(that is \(d\mathbb Z\) is the set of all multiplies of \(d\)) is an example
of an ideal.  The following shows that this is basically the only example.


<br><br>
<b>Theorem:</b><i>
	If \(I\) is then either \(I = \{0\}\) or there is a \(d>0\)
	such that \(I = d \mathbb Z\).
</i><br><br>

<b>Outline of proof.</b>  We have done this in class so here we only give
the basic ideal of what is going on.  If \(I = \{0\}\), then
we are done.  So assume \(I \ne \{0\})\).   Then, by the well ordering
principle, \(I\) has a smallest positive element.  Call it \(d\). 
Then \( d \in I\) and so for any \(\in \mathbb Z\) we have, by 
the definition of an ideal, that \( nd \in I\).  Therefore
\(d\mathbb Z \subseteq I\).
<br>
<br>

Let \(a \in I\) and use the division algorithm do find in integers \(q\)
and \(r\) with
\[
a = qd+r \quad 0 \le r \lt d.
\]
Then \( r = a +(-q)d\) and so by the basic closure properties of ideals \(r \in I\).
Since \(0\le  r\lt d\) and \(d\) is the smallest positive element of $I$,
	  this implies \(r=0\) and so \(a= qd\) is a multipple of \(d\),
	  that is \(a \in d \mathbb Z\).  As \(a\) was an arbitary element
of \(I\) we have \( I \subseteq d\mathbb Z\). <b>QED</b> 

<br>
<br>

Here is an application of the last result to prove something that we will use
many times during the course of the semester. 

<br><br>
<b>Theorem (gcd = linear combination.)</b><i>
Let \(a\) and \(b\) be integers, not both zero.  Then the greatest
common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) exists and is an integral
linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\). That is there are
integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that 
$$
ax + by = \gcd(a,b).
$$
</i><br><br>


<b>Outline of proof.</b>  This  is anther result we did in class so only the 
bare bones of the argument will be give here.   Let
$$
I = \{ ax+ by: x,y \in \mathbb Z\} 
$$
be the set of all integral linear combinations of \(a\) and \(b\).  
Then it is not hard to check that \(I\) is an ideal and that
$$
a = a\cdot 1 + b \cdot 0\in I \qquad \text{and}\qquad b = a\cdot 0 + b \cdot 1 \in I.
$$
By the previous theorem there is a \( d > 0\) such that \(I = d\mathbb Z\).
<p>

We now show that \(d = \gcd(a,b)\).  First not \(a,b\in I = d \mathbb Z\)
and therefore each of \(a\) and \(b\) is a multiple of \(d\).  That is
\(d\) divides each of \(a\) and \(b\).
<p>

Also from the definition \(I\) as the set of all integral linear combinations
of \(a\) and \(b\) and because \(d \in I\) we see that there are integers \(x\) and \(y\) such 
$$
d = ax + by.
$$
Assume that \( c \mid a \) and \( c \mid b\).  Then there are
integers \(a'\) and \(b'\) with \(a = ca'\) and \(b = c b'\).
Then
$$
d = ax+by = ca'x + cb'y = c(a'x + b'y)
$$
which shows that \( c \mid d\).  Looking back at the definition
of greatest common divisor we see \(d = \gcd(a,b)\).
<b>QED</b>  

<h2> The Euclidean algorithm and the greatest common divisor.</h2>

There is a more concrete method of showing that \(gcd(a,b)\) can be
written as an integral linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\) which goes
back to Euclid.  It is based on

<br><br>
<b>Theorem:</b><i>
	If \(a\) and \(b\) are integers with \(b\ne 0\) and
	for some integers \(q\) and \(r\) we have
	$$
	a = qb | r
	$$
	then 
	$$
	\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(r,b).
	$$

Here is the how this is used to find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.
Starting with \(a\) and \(b\) assume \(b \le a\).  If \( b \mid a\) 
then \( \gcd(a,b) = b\).

	Then we divide \(b\)
into \(a\) 
	$$
	a = qb + r \qquad \text{with \(0 \le r \lt b\)}.
	$$
Then we have just shown
	$$
	\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,r)
	$$
and we have \( r \lt b \le a\) so we have made one of the numbers
involved in computing the GCD smaller.  Now divide \( r \) 
into \( b \)
$$
b = q_2 r + r_2
$$
with \( 0 \le r_2 \lt r\) and
$$
\gcd(r_1,r) = \gcd(r,b) = \gcd(a,b),
$$
and we have reduced the problem to one with even smaller numbers.
We continue in this manner until we get a remainder of \( 0 \) in 
which case the GCD is the last divisor.   More formally this looks 
like 
\begin{align*}
a&= bq_1 + r_1 &\text{with}& & 0 \le r_1  \lt b\\
b&= bq_2 + r_2 &\text{with}& & 0 \le r_2  \lt r_1\\
b&= bq_3 + r_3 &\text{with}& & 0 \le r_3  \lt r_2\\
b&= bq_4 + r_4 &\text{with}& & 0 \le r_4  \lt r_3\\
b&= bq_5 + r_5 &\text{with}& & 0 \le r_5  \lt r_4\\
&&\text{until \(r_k=0\) }&&
\end{align*}
This method is the <b>Euclidean algorithm</b>.

<b>Problem:</b>
Use the Euclidean algorithm to find \( \gcd(54,552)\).
