<DD> <I> Brief Calculus</I> by Hughes-Hallet, Gleason <I>et.al.</I>.
<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Calculators: </FONT></strong><BR> 
<DD> The class demonstrations will be with the TI-83 and most of this
    should also apply to the TI-82.  There are  several types of
    calculators that will do all that is required for the class and you
    are welcome to use them. <I>However</I> for calculators other than the
    TI-83 and TI-82 I will not be able to help with the programming.



<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Grading: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> There will be three midterms of 100 points
    each. Homework will be collected and will count for 150 points.
    The Final will count for 150 points.  Finally there will be 20
    points for class presentations (and people who go to the board
    regularly can get fairly substantial extra credit above this 20
    points). This gives a total of 620 points and you grade will be
    based on the total out of the 620. 
    In summary:<SPACER TYPE=vertical SIZE=7>

</TABLE>
</CENTER><SPACER TYPE=vertical SIZE=7>
Note that the homework counts as much as the final so it is
important to spend time on the homework.  Some homework many be
``collected'' in the form of in class quizzes. 
 Letter grades will be assigned to all
the tests. In general the curve on the midterms will be  A~90--100,
                         B~80--89,
                         C~70--79,
                         D~60--69,
                         F~0--59,  but this can vary. 
The last day to drop is February~18 and you should have a
good idea of where you stand by then.





 The dates of the tests will be:

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> There will be not make up exams or quizzes: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> If you miss
    a test, then your score on that exam is 75% of the average of
    your other test scores including the final.  If a second exam is
    messed the score on it is zero.  Exams will be taken in class on
    the days listed above.  So don't ask to take an exam early or late
    because you have to be ``out of town'' or some other reason.  Late
    homework will not be accepted.  Likewise there will be not make up
    quizzes.  If you miss a quiz then you lose the points.  As a
    reward to anyone who turns on all the homework and takes all the
    quizzes will get 10 extra points.  Missing only one homework or
    quiz is worth 5 extra points.  On the other hand if someone leave
    class early without permission  then I reserve the right to give
    them a zero on the homework for the day.

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">Sharing calculators on quizzes and tests is not  allowed:</FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> You should bring your calculator to every class meeting and
    especially to tests.  If you do not bring it them you will not be
    allowed to share a calculator with someone else from the class on
    quizzes or tests and will thus lose the points on those questions
    that need a calculator.  


<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">Remarks on how the class will be run:</FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> Unlike many classes not very much time in this class is going to be
    devoted to lecturing. Much of the class time will be spent in working
    problems often in small groups of 3 to 5 people. The problems will usual
    be directly from the homework. Also instead of just having the instructor
    give you the answer people from the class will present the answers at the
    board (this is the ``class presentation" part of the grade). 
<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">Getting Help:</FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD>Besides my office hours you can get help in the 
   <a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~murphy/mathlab.html">Math Lab.</a>
   This is a free tutoring service supplied by the mathematics
   department.  Starting this semester it will have three locations
   LeConte 101, Towers' Conference Center, and Bates Area.  The hours
   that the math lab is open can be found 
<a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~murphy/mathlab.html">here</a>.



<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">About partial credit and bad algebra: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> Some arithmetic errors  do not bother me much.  If your
     get in a hurry and get 7<TT>x</TT>8=48 it is not going to cost you
     much, provided you are doing every thing else correctly.
     However, there are certain mistakes (all involving misuse of high
     school in such a way that <I>always</I> gives the wrong answer), that will
     not be tolerated. If you make these
     mistakes I will mark the entire problem wrong.  Here are some
     examples of zero point errors:

This is not meant to scare you, but just to let you know where things
stand.
