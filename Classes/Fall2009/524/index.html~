Peressini, Sullivan, and Uhl.
<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Computer Accounts: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> Some of the homework will require computer programming and you
will receive accounts for the term on the mathematics department
machines.  



<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Remark:</FONT> </strong><DD>
The homework, tests, quizzes, and <a href="syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>
 are in pdf format and can be read with Adobe's

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Homework and Quizzes: </FONT>
</strong><BR> 
<DD>Homework will count for 100 points.  Part of the homework grade will
be in class quizzes.  Usually these quizzes will be on definitions,
facts, or theorems that you should know.  Generally it will be announced
in the previous class what will be on the quiz.   <b>Note that the
homework counts as much as a test, so it is important that you do it.</b>

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">Projects: </FONT>
</strong><BR> 
<DD>There will be two longer projects, most likely involving a little
computer programming which will count for 25 points each.




<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Grading: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> The there is a total of  600 points possible for the term broken
down as follows:
<SPACER TYPE=vertical SIZE=7>

<TABLE> 
<TR><TD> Three midterms @ 100 points each </TD>
    <TD> 300 points</TD></TR>

    <TD> 150 points </TD></TR>
<TR><TD> Total </TD>
    <TD> 600 points </TD></TD>
</TABLE>

Your grade will be based on the total out of 600.  The last day to
drop without a grade of WF is October 4 and you should have a good
idea of where you stand by then.



<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> There will be not make up exams or
quizzes: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD>  If you miss a test, then your score on that exam is 75% of the
      average of your other test scores including the final. Likewise
      I will not take late homework.
