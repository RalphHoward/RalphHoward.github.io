There are many reasons for learning to produce a LaTeX document.  The main one
is that LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of
scientific documents.  Most journals in mathematics and many of the other
sciences expect papers to be submitted in some form of LaTeX. It
is not uncommon in some graduate classes that homework
be submitted as LaTeX output.  And currently 
(that is during the coronavirus pandemic) it is the best way to produce 
papers that are easy to send by e-mail and easily read by the 
recipient. 
<p><p>


If you already know how to produce a LaTeX document, you can 
ignore most of the instructions here.  


<p><p><p>
Step 1: Getting started. <br>

<li><b>Using your school email address</b>, register for a 
(free) Overleaf account by going to  
<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/register">Overleaf/register</a>. 




<li>Next view the 2 minute video at 
<a href="https://youtu.be/rLWT0z6yvrk">
Writing a basic LaTeX document with overleaf</a>. 
You should understand the first minute of the video 
(0:00-1:02).  For the part after 1:02 (when he is 
typing stuff such as \documentclass) just try to 
get the idea of how to (re)compile a document.  


<p><p><p>
Step 2: Your first Latex Project<br>
 

<li>Log into your Overleaf account at 
<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/login">Overleaf</a>.

<li>Select the <tt>New Project</tt> icon
<font size=1>(left column  tool bar with green background)</font>, 
and then from the drop down selection chose  <tt>Blank Project</tt>.
<br>  
A window should pop up asking you to  name your New Project.
"Latex 1" is a reasonable name.
<br>



Delete the code in the source window and 
take the following code and cut and paste it into Overleaf (or
whatever you are using for LaTeX) and edit it to complete the 
following three lines:
<br>
My name is
<br>
My major is
<br>
S=
<br>

Then compile it and send the resulting pdf to me with the 
subject line: LaTeX 1.


<pre>
\documentclass{article}  % Tell LaTeX what type of document we are making.
                         % Percent signs are used for comments and what is
                         % to the right of them is ignored.

\begin{document}  %  Start the document.


Hello world.   (Included so as to not offend the Computer Gods.)



Ordinary text (that is non mathematical text) is just typed
as usual ordinary text.  But LaTeX will decide where the line
breaks are.

A new paragraph is started by leaving one or more blank lines.

My name is 

My major is 

% Mathematical formulas in a line are put between \(  and \)

The basic quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c =0\).  


% Displayed mathematical formulas are put between \[ and \]

This can be done in one line \[ ax^2+bx+c=0. \]
But it is usually easier to read your code if you make it look
displayed 
\[
  ax^2+bx+c=0.
\]
(LaTeX will not care, but if you are looking at your code a month after
writing it you will.)

Let us give a slightly more complicated displayed equation
which gives a good idea of what general LaTeX looks like:
\[
	x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
\]

A basic formula in much of analysis is the sum of a geometric 
series
\[
   \frac{a}{1-r}= a+ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4+ \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n
\]
which converges for $|r|<1$.
Thus if
\[
	S = 3 + 3 x + 3 x^2 + 2 x^3 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 3x^n
\]
we have
\[
  S =     %  You fill this in.
\]

\end{document}

</pre>

A point that is confusing at first is
that in LaTeX there are several ways to do the same thing.  For
example to do in line mathematics both
<pre>
\( ax^2 + bx + 2 \)
</pre>
and 
<pre>
$ a x^2 + bx + c $
</pre> 
give the same output. Worse yet is displayed formulas where
all three of 
<pre>
\[
a x^2 + bx + c
\]
</pre> 
<pre>
$$
a x^2 + bx + c
$$
</pre>
and
<pre>
\begin{equation*}
a x^2 + bx + c
\end{equation*}
</pre>
give the same output.  So in some of the videos recommended 
below things will look a bit different than what I have above.
You and use whatever you find easiest for you.

Overleaf used to be named ShareLaTeX.  Under this name
they have nice series of videos explaining both LaTeX
and Overleaf.  If you are not use to LaTeX you should watch
