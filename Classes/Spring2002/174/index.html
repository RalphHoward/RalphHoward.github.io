<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Grading: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> There will be three midterms of 100 points
    each. Homework will be collected and will count for 100 points.
    The Final will count for 150 points. This gives a total of 550
    points and you grade will be  based on the total out of the 550. 
    In summary:<SPACER TYPE=vertical SIZE=7>

<SPACER TYPE=vertical SIZE=7>
Note that the homework counts as much as a test so it is
important to spend time on the homework.  
 Letter grades will be assigned to all
the tests. In general the curve on the midterms will be  
 A 90-100,
 B 80-89,
 C 70-79,
 D 60-69,
 F 0-59,  but this can vary. 
The last day to drop is Monday, February 2  and you should have a
reasonable idea of where you stand by then.<P>

The dates of the tests will be:

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Quizzes: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD>  There will be in class quizzes.  They will be part of your
homework score.
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> There will be not make up exams or quizzes: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> If you miss
    a test, then your score on that exam is 75% of the average of
    your other test scores including the final.  If a second exam is
    messed the score on it is zero.  Exams will be taken in class on
    the days listed above.  So don't ask to take an exam early or late
    because you have to be ``out of town'' or some other reason.  Late
    homework will not be accepted.  Likewise there will be not make up
    quizzes.  If you miss a quiz then you lose the points.  As a
    reward to anyone who turns on all the homework and takes all the
    quizzes will get 10 extra points.  Missing only one homework or
    quiz is worth 5 extra points.  On the other hand if someone leaves
    class early without permission  then I reserve the right to give
    them a zero on the homework or quiz for the day.

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">Getting Help:</FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD>Besides my office hours you can get help in the 
   <a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~murphy/mathlab.html">Math Lab.</a>
   This is a free tutoring service supplied by the mathematics
   department.  Starting this semester it will have three locations
   LeConte 101, Towers' Conference Center, and Bates Area.  The hours
   that the math lab is open can be found 
<a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~murphy/mathlab.html">here</a>.

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">About partial credit and bad
    algebra: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> Some arithmetic errors  do not bother me much.  If your
     get in a hurry and get 7<TT>x</TT>8=48 it is not going to cost you
     much, provided you are doing every thing else correctly.
     However, there are certain mistakes (involving misuse of high
     school in such a way that <I>always</I> gives the wrong answer), that will
     not be tolerated. If you make these
     mistakes I will mark the entire problem wrong.  Here are some
     examples of zero point errors:

This is not meant to scare you, but just to let you know where things
stand.
