<h3>The argument principle and residues at higher order poles.</h3> 

<i>
These notes are set up so that you get to prove the main results
by solving smaller problems that when put together give the big result.
The answers to the problems are in the videos.  
You will get the most out of these notes if you do (or try) the problems
before looking at the videos.

We have seen that if \(f(z)\) has a simple pole at $z=a$, say
$$
f(z)= \frac{g(z)}{h(z)} 
$$
where \(h(a)=0\) and \(h'(a)\ne 0\) then the residue of \(f\) at
\(z=a\) 
$$
\Res(f,a) = \frac{g(a)}{h'(a)} 
$$
<br>

We have also seen that if 
$f(z)$ has a root of order \(m\) at \(z=a\), then it can be written as
$$
f(z) = (z-a)^mf_0(z)
$$
where \(f_0(z)\) is analytic near \(a\) and \(f_0(a)\ne 0\). Cauchy
noticed that these two facts could be put together to give 
a nice result.
<br>
<br>

<b>Proposition.</b> <i>
Let \(f(z)\) have a zero of order \(m\) at \(z=a\).  Then 
the function
$$
\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} 
$$
has a simple pole at \(z=a\) and the residue is
$$
\Res\Big( \frac{f'}{f} , a\Big) = m.
$$
That is the residue of \( \dfrac{f'}{f}\) at \(z=a\) is the
order of the zero of \(f\) at \(z=a\).
</i>


<b>Problem 1.</b> Prove this by writing \(f(z)\) as
$$
f(z) = (z-a)^m f_0(z)
$$
with \(f_0(a)\ne 0\) and computing \(\dfrac{f'}{f}\) and seeing that it
has simple pole with the residue of \(m\).

 Now let \(D\) be a bounded domain with nice boundary and let
 \(f(z)\) be analytic on the \(D\) and boundary and assume
 that \(f(z)\ne 0\) for \(z\) on \(\partial D\).  Then 
 $$
 \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} 
 $$
 will be analytic on \(D\) expect at with isolated singularities 
 at the zeros of \(f\).  
If we now apply the residue theorem to this function the result
is

<b>Theorem (The argument principle)</b> <i>
	Let \(f(z)\) be analytic on the closure of the bounded 
	domain \(D\) and assume that \(f(z)\) has no zeros
	on the boundary \(\partial D\).  Then
	$$
	\int_{\partial D} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz =
	2\pi i (\text{the number of zeros of \(f(z)\) in \(D\)})
	$$
	where the zeros are counted with multiplicity. 
	(That is a zero of order \(m\) is counted \(m\) times.)

The zeros of \(f(z)\) are the solutions to \(f(z)=0\).  There
is nothing special about solving for \(0\),  we could have just
as easily looked for solutions to \(f(z)=b\) for for some constant
\(b\).  So a slightly more general version of the last theorem is
<br>
<br>


<b>Theorem </b> <i>
	Let \(f(z)\) be analytic on the closure of the bounded 
	domain \(D\) and assume that \(f(z)=b\) has no solutions
	on the boundary \(\partial D\).  Then
	$$
	\int_{\partial D} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz =
	2\pi i (\text{number of solution of \(f(z)=b\)})
	$$
	where the solutions are counted with multiplicity. 
	(That is the if \(f(a)=b\) then \(a\) is counted  \(m\) times
	if \(f(z)-b\) has a zero of order \(m\).)

So far we only have an easy to use formula for finding the residue
of functions at simple poles.  So let take a small step toward messier
and look at a pole of order \(2\).  So we have a function whose 
Laurent expansion looks like
$$
	f(z)= \frac{c_{-2}}{(z-a)^2} + \frac{c_{-1}}{(z-a)} + c_0 + c_1(z-a)
	+ c_2(z-a)^2 + \dots
$$
and our job is to compute the residue at \(z=a\), that is
the coefficient \(c_{-1}\).  The idea to to clear of fractions
by multiplying by \((z-a)^2\) and then use the same argument that
we have used to find the coefficients of a Taylor's expansion.

<b>Proposition.</b> <i>  With the setup we have just given, 
the residue of \(f\) at \(z=a\) is
$$
\Res(f,a) = c_{-1} = \lim_{z\to a} \frac{d}{dz} \Big( (z-a)^2f(z)\big).
$$
