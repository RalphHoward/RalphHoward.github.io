<h3>The Residue Theorem.</h3> 

<i>
These notes are set so that you get to prove the main results
by solving smaller problems that when put together give the big result.
The answers to the problems are in the videos.  
You will get the most out of these notes if you do (or try) the problems

We first recall a special case of what we have proven about 
Laurent series.  Recall that \(a\) is an <b><i>isolated singularity</i></b>
of an analytic function \(f(z0\) if and only if for some \(r_0\gt 0\)
the function \(f(z)\) is analytic in the punctured disk 
$$
\{ z : 0\lt |z-a|\lt r_0\}.
$$
Then \(f(z)\) has a <b><i>Laurent series</i></b> 
$$
f(z) = \sum_{n = \infty}^\infty c_n (z-a)^n
$$
which converges in the punctured disk.  
We have also seen that if \( 0\le r \le r_0 \) that
$$
\int_{|z-z|=r} f(z) \,dz = 2 \pi i\, c_{-1}.
$$
Therefore when integrating around this isolated singularity the 
only coefficient in the Laurent expansion that matters is \(c_{-1}\),
that is the coefficient of \( (z-a)^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{(z-a)}\).  
This number is important enough that we give it a name.  
<br><br>
<b>Definition.</b> If \(f(z)\) has an isolated singularity at 
\(z=a\) and a Laurent expansion as above, then the <b><i>residue</i></b>
of \(f(z)\) at \(a\) is
$$
\Res(f(z),a) = c_{-1}.
$$
That is the residue is the coefficient of \( (z-a)^{-1}\) in the 
Laurent expansion at \(z=a\).  
<br>
<br>

With this definition we can restate one of the formulas above as
$$
\int_{|z-a|=r} f(z)\,dz = 2\pi i \Res(f,a).
$$

<b>Problem.</b> Let \(D\) be a bounded domain with nice boundary 
and let \(f(z)\) be a function that is analytic on the closure 
of \(D\) other than two isolated singularities at the points
\(a\) and \(b\) inside of \(D\).  Show 
$$
\int_{\partial D} f(z) \,dz = 2\pi i \Big( \Res(f,a) + \Res(f,b)\Big)
$$

There was clearly nothing special about there only being two 
isolated singularities of the function \(f(z)\) in the domain.
So you have just proven the following theorem which is originally
do to Cauchy.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Residue Theorem.</b> <i>  Let \(D\)) be a bounded domain
	with nice boundary and \(f(z)\) a function that is analytic
	on the closure of \(D\) with the exception of 
	a finite number \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m\) of isolated 
	singularities of \(f(z)\) which are inside of \(D\).
	Then 
	$$
	\int_{\partial D} f(z)\,dz = 2 \pi i \sum_{j=1}^m \Res(f,a_j).
	$$
A bit more informally:  The integral of \(f(z)\) over the boundary of
\(D\) is \(2 \pi i\) times the sum of the residues of \(f\) inside 
of \(D\).

For this to be useful, and it is very useful, we need to be able to compute
residues of functions in an efficient manner.  Fortunately in many of the cases
where we wish to use the Residue Theorem the singularities are simple enough
that there is an easy way to compute them.  
<br>
<br>

<b>Definition.</b>  The function \(f(z)\) has a <b><i>simple pole</i></b>
at the point \(z=a\) if and only if its Laurent expansion at \(a\) is of the form
$$
f(z) = \frac{c_{-1}}{z-a} + c_0 + c_1(z-a) + c_2(z-a)^2 + c_3(z-a)^3 + \dots
$$
<br>
<br>

<b>Problem.</b>  If \(f(z)\) has a simple pole at \(z=a\) show that the
residue of \(f(z)\) at \(z=a\) is
$$
\Res(f,a) = \lim_{z\to a} (z-a)f(z).
$$

The following gives an easy way to recognize simple poles.
The proof, while not hard, will wait to later.

<br><br>
<b> Proposition.</b>
<i>
Let 
$$
f(z) = \frac{g(z)}{h(z)}
$$
where both \(g\) and \(h\) are analytic near \(z=a\).  Assume
that 
$$
h(a)=0\qquad\text{and}\qquad h'(a)\ne 0.
$$
Then \(f(z)\) has a simple pole at \(z=a\).
</i>

<br>
When simple poles arise in this manner it is particularly simple 
to compute their residues. 
<br><br>
<b>Proposition.</b>
<i> Let \(f(z)\) be as in the proposition above.  Then
$$
\Res(f,a) = \frac{g(a)}{h'(a)}.
$$
</i>
<br>
<b>Problem.</b> Prove this.
