<pre>
function y = matvect(A,x);
% This is a MatLab function to compute product of a matrix A
% and a vector x.  
% By Ralph Howard on 1/15/98
% Call syntax: y = matvect(a,b) or matvect(a,b)
% Input: The matrix A and the vector x
% Output: The product Ax
m=size(A,1);			% m = number of rows of A
n=size(A,2);			% n = number of columns of A
c=linspace(0,0,m)';		% column vector of n 0's
for i=1:m			% start the loop for i
	for j=1:n			% start the loop for j
		c(i)=c(i)+A(i,j)*x(j);	% update the i-th entry
	end;				% end j loop
end;					% end i loop
ans = c			% Value of A*v is printed at end of loop

<li>In my first version of this program I used
<tt> y </tt> rather than <tt> c </tt> for the variable in the loop.
MatLab did not like this as <tt> y </tt> had been reserved as the name
of the function in the first line of the program.  The result was that
the answer was printed twice rather than just once.  Thus if you have
trouble with getting more output than you should, one possibility is
that a variable reserved for the function name in the first line of
the program has been used.
<li> The commands <tt> size(A,1)</tt> and <tt>size(A,2)</tt> give the
number of rows and columns of a matrix.  For more information see
<a href="matinfo.html"> getting information about matrices</a>.
<li> In this program the column zero vector of length <i>m</i> was 
defined by <tt> c=linspace(0,0,m)'</tt>.  There are other ways to
define this vector.  For example <tt> c=zeros(m,1)</tt>.  For more
information on this see <a href="special.html"> defining special
matrices</a>.
