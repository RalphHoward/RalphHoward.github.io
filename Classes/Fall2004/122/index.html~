<DD> <I> Applied Calculus</I> by Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, Lock, Flath,
<I>et.al.</I>




<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Calculators: </FONT></strong><BR>
<DD> A calculator such as the TI-83 (preferred) or TI-82.  There are
several types of calculators that will do all that is required for the
class and you are welcome to use them.  <i>However</i> the class
demonstrations with be with the TI-83 and for other types of
calculators I may have trouble helping with the programming (but I
will try to help).

<strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Remark:</FONT> </strong> <BR>
<DD>
The homework, quizes, workseheets, tests, and <a
href="http:syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>
 are in pdf format and can
be read with Adobe's Acrobat Reader which can down loaded <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">here.</a>



<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Tests: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> There will be three midterms and a final.  The midterms count for
100 points each and the final is 150 points.  The dates of the tests
are

<TABLE> 
<TR><TD> Test 1</TD>

<TR><TD> Final </TD> 
    <TD> Monday, December 10, 9:00a.m.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>


<DT><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Homework and quizzes: </FONT> </strong>
<DD> Homework will count for 100 points. Part of the homework grade
will be in class quizzes.  . Generally the quizzes will be announced
on the previous class. <b>Note that the homework counts as much as a
test, so it is important that you do it.</b>





<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> Grading: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> The there is a total of  550 points possible for the term broken
down as follows:
<SPACER TYPE=vertical SIZE=7>
<CENTER>
<TABLE> 
<TR><TD> Three midterms @ 100 points each </TD>
    <TD> 300 points</TD></TR>

<TR><TD> Final </TD>
    <TD> 150 points </TD></TR>
<TR><TD> Total </TD>
    <TD> 550 points </TD></TD>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
Your grade will be based on the total out of 550.  The last day to
drop without a grade of WF is October 4 and you should have a good
idea of where you stand by then.





<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> There will be not make up exams or quizzes: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> If you miss
    a test, then your score on that exam is 75% of the average of
    your other test scores including the final.  If a second exam is
    messed the score on it is zero.  Exams will be taken in class on
    the days listed above.  So don't ask to take an exam early or late
    because you have to be ``out of town'' or some other reason.  Late
    homework will not be accepted.  Likewise there will be not make up
    quizzes.  If you miss a quiz then you lose the points.  As a
    reward to anyone who turns on all the homework and takes all the
    quizzes will get 10 extra points.  Missing only one homework or
    quiz is worth 5 extra points.  On the other hand if someone leave
    class early without permission  then I reserve the right to give
    them a zero on the homework for the day.

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">Sharing calculators on quizzes and
tests is not  allowed:</FONT> </strong><BR>  
<DD> You should bring your calculator to every class meeting and
    especially to tests.  If you do not bring it them you will not be
    allowed to share a calculator with someone else from the class on
    quizzes or tests and will thus lose the points on those questions
    that need a calculator.  

<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">Getting Help:</FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD>Besides my office hours you can get help in the 
   <a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~murphy/mathlab.html">Math Lab.</a>
   This is a free tutoring service supplied by the mathematics
   department.  There are three locations
   LeConte 101, Towers' Conference Center, and Bates Area.  The hours
   that the math lab is open can be found 
<a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~murphy/mathlab.html">here</a>.



<DT><strong><FONT COLOR="#FFCD39">About partial credit and bad algebra: </FONT> </strong><BR> 
<DD> Some arithmetic errors  do not bother me much.  If your
     get in a hurry and get 7<TT>x</TT>8=48 it is not going to cost you
     much, provided you are doing every thing else correctly.
     However, there are certain mistakes (all involving misuse of high
     school in such a way that <I>always</I> gives the wrong answer), that will
     not be tolerated. If you make these
     mistakes I will mark the entire problem wrong.  Here are some
     examples of zero point errors:

This is not meant to scare you, but just to let you know where things
stand.
