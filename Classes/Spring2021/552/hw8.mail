Homework 8 is ow on the class webpage.  A big part of it is
review and also a slightly different presentation of what
we did in class today.  At least the first four problems will
be due at the beginning of next week, so it would be a good
idea to start looking a them now so that if you have questions
I can answer them on Wednesday.
