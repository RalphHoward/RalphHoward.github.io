<I>Caiman crocodilus crocodilus</I></A>), and she was a very important

time there.  Her many friends still miss her.  I do take some comfort

red tailed hawk</A> (<A

jamaicensis</I></A>) and a 
<A HREF="http://www.applink.net/cpollard/kestrel.htm"> sparrow
hawk</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.raptor.cvm.umn.edu/raptor/rfacts/amkest.html"> 
American Kestrel</A> 
(<A HREF="http://www.imagehouse.com/adventure/wilderness/birds/kestrel.htm"><I>Falco
sparvarius</I></A>).
Both were birds that had minor head injuries from flying into power
lines.  After having kept for several months both recovered enough to
be released.
