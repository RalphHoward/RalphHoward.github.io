<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B> Analysis on Homogeneous Spaces.</B></FONT><BR> 
Notes from a class titled <i> Harmonic  Analysis on Homogeneous
Spaces</i> given at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm in the
spring of 1994.  They are elementary, incomplete, and disorganized, but
redeem themselves by having lots of miss-prints and an index.

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B>A Question whose Answer is 42.
</B></FONT><BR> A straight tunnel is cut through the Earth, but not
necessary though its center.  Arthur Dent starts at rest at one end of
the tunnel and slides, without friction or air resistance and only
under the force of gravity, until he reaches the other end of the
tunnel.  <i>Question:</i> How long does the trip take Arthur?  <UL>

Given a planet of uniform density and a point on its surface, how can
we reshape the planet to maximize the gravitational force at the given
point.

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B>The Milnor-Rogers proof of the Brouwer
Fixed Point Theorem.</B></FONT><BR> An exposition of the analytic
proof of Milnor, as simplified by Rogers, of the Brouwer Fixed Point
Theorem.  All that is required is the inverse function theorem and the
change of variable formula for multiple integrals.

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B>A counterexample to one of my favorite
conjectures.</B></FONT><BR> For a smooth compact manifold <i>M</i> let
<i>S(M)</i> be the space of infinitely differentiable real valued
functions on <i>M</i>.  Given two manifolds <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> with
dim(<i>M</i>)> dim(<i>N</i>) it is shown that there are injective
linear  linear maps of finite order from <i>S(M)</i> to <i>S(N)</i>.
I had conjecture that all such maps have infinite dimensional kernel,
which, if it had been true, would have explained many non-injectiveity
results in integral geometry.

If the set <b>C</b> of compact subsets of <b>R</b><sup>n</sup> is given made
into a metric space using the Hausdorff distance, then set of <i>K</i>
in <b>C</b> with dense cut locus dense in <b>R</b><sup>n</sup> is a dense

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B>Fubini's Theorem on the Termwise
Differentiable of Series with Monotone Terms.</B></FONT><BR>
If <i>f(x)=f<sub>1</sub>(x)+f<sub>2</sub>(x)+f<sub>3</sub>(x)+...</i>
is a pointwise convergent series of function each of which is monotone
increasing, then we give a proof of Fubini's result 
that the derivative is given by
<i>f '(x)=f<sub>1</sub>'(x)+f<sub>2</sub>'(x)+f<sub>3</sub>'(x)+...</i>
almost everywhere.  This is used to an easy example of function that
is continuous, strictly increasing, but has derivative zero almost
everywhere.

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B>Mohammad Ghomi's Solution to the
Illumination Problem.</B></FONT><BR> 
An exposition of a recent result of <a
href="http://www.math.gatech.edu/~ghomi/">Mohammad Ghomi</a> who 
has shown that if <i>M</i> is smooth compact
oriented surface in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> so that all the shadow sets
of <i>M</i> are simply connected, then <i>M</i> is the boundary of a
convex set.  Also given is his example showing that "simply connected"
can not be weakened to "connected".

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B>Characterization of Tantrix
Curves.</B></FONT><BR> 
Let <i>c(t)</i> be a regular curve in the Euclidean space
<b>R<sup>3</sup></b>.  Then the <b>tantrix</b> is the curve on the
sphere <i>S<sup>2</sup></i> given by
<b>t</b>(t)=<i>c'(t)/</i>|<i>c'(t)</i>|.  A proof of a folk theorem
characterizing the tantrix curves of closed curves is given and
extended to higher dimensions and the case of curves symmetric with
respect to a group action.

Surfaces in Space.</B></FONT><BR> 
If a light is shined on a surface, the boundary between the light and the

Derivatives of Convex Functions.</B></FONT><BR> 
Notes giving a
detailed proof of Alexandrov's Theorem that a convex suction has second
derivatives almost everywhere.  This done by use of Rademacher's

derivatives almost everywhere) whose proof is also included.

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B> John's Theorem on Ellipsoids in Convex
Bodies.</B></FONT><BR> 
A proof is given of the result of Fritz John that if <I>K</I> is a convex body
in <I>R<SUP>n</SUP></I> and <I>E</I> is the ellipsoid of maximum volume in
<I>K</I> then <I>K</I> is contained in <I>c</I>+<I>n(K</I>-<I>c)</I>.
When <I>K</I> is symmetric about the origin this can be improved so that
<I>K</I> is contained in <I>n<sup>1/2</sup>E</I>.

and <A HREF ="http://www.math.sc.edu/people/roberts.html">Jim
Roberts</A>).  The differences are extra figures, some exposition of results

Some notes based on lectures of

number of points a "random" sum of a set of <I>n</I> vectors, 
not clustered about any hyperplane,  that can lie in a 
sufficiently small set.

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B>The Gronwall Inequality for Solutions
to Ordinary Differential Equations.</B></FONT><BR> 
A version of the Gronwall inequality that estimates the difference
between solutions to two differential equations in terms of the
difference between their initial conditions and how how much the two
equations differ.

<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FFCD39"> <B> The Loewner-Pu Inequality, Isosystolic
Constants, and Quasi-Conformal Geometry.</B></FONT><BR> The
Loewner-Pu inequality is generalized to Riemannian metrics <I>g</I> on
an <I>n</I> dimensional torus <I>T<SUP>n</SUP></I> that are 
<I>C</I>-quasi-conformal to a flat metric where the resulting inequality
relates <I>C</I> and some isosytolic constants.  For <I>n &#62
2</I> this can be combined with recent results of Babenko and Katz to 
give examples of smooth metrics that have arbitrarily large
"quasi-conformal distance" from the set of flat metrics on
<I>T<SUP>n</SUP></I>.

conjugate points is flat.  An extension to higher dimensions, due to
L. Green, is also given.  The proof follows that of Green.

A proof of the result of Kuiper that a
compact simply connected locally conformal flat Riemannian manifold is
globally conformally equivalent to the standard sphere.  The proof
here, while it follows the basic outline of Kuiper's proof, requires
less smoothness of the metric.

If all principle curvatures of a complete hypersurface <I>M</I> of 
Euclidean space <B>R</B><I><sup>n</sup></I> have absolute value at
most one then at any point of <I>M</I> the graphing radius is at least
one.  This is used to prove results on the inradius of domains in
terms of the topology and the size of the principle curvatures.
